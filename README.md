# PowerShell Script Library

A collection of reusable, tenant-agnostic PowerShell scripts for Microsoft 365 and general Windows administration.

## Structure

- `EOPS/` — Scripts for Exchange Online PowerShell (e.g., bulk user operations)
- `CMD/` — Batch scripts for local automation
- `Utils/` — Utility functions (e.g., CSV converters, logging helpers)

## Getting Started

Ensure the appropriate modules are installed for each environment. Each folder contains its own README with usage examples.
